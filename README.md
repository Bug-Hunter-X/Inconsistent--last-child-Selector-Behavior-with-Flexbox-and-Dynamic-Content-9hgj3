# Inconsistent :last-child Selector Behavior with Flexbox and Dynamic Content

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the CSS `:last-child` pseudo-class when used with flexbox and dynamically added elements.  The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of DOM manipulation and CSS rendering.  The `:last-child` selector may not immediately reflect the addition of new elements, leading to unexpected styling.

## Problem Description

The provided CSS styles elements within a flex container.  JavaScript code dynamically adds elements to this container. However, the `:last-child` selector does not reliably target the last child after the dynamic addition.  This inconsistency occurs because the browser's rendering engine may not immediately update the styles after the DOM changes.

## Solution

The solution involves using JavaScript to explicitly restyle elements after they are added to the DOM.  This forces the browser's rendering engine to recalculate the styles.  Alternatively, avoiding reliance on `:last-child` and using a different styling approach could resolve this issue completely.
